TotoyeVN is a javascript game engine library used to create visual novel as web game. But, there's another project called TotoyeVN Studio  which is a software created by the same developer that uses the TotoyeVN library to create visual novels as both HTML5 and Java games.
The version 2.0 is a great upgrade of the library which makes your game run faster than before and with syntax easier to understand.
